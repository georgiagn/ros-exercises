# ros-exercises
This repository contains the ROS code for the exercises of the Udacity Nanodegree in [Robotics Software Engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209). The five projects of the nanodegree build upon each other, while addressing the topics of localization, mapping and SLAM, path planning and navigation.

More info on the project objectives and how to run the code will be added very soon!
