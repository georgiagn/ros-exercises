File structure:
- All required ROS packages can be found under src/.
- scripts/ contains all scripts to test the concepts of the Home Service Robot project.
- The world and map files can be found under src/my_robot/worlds/my.world and src/my_robot/maps/map.yaml (pgm), respectively. The file paths are set as environment variables in the scripts.
- rvizConfig/ contains the rviz configuration file which is used to display the Markers. It's linked to in the view_navigation.launch file of the turtlebot_rviz_launchers package.

Instructions to test the project concepts:
0. Set up environment under /home/workspace/ (important for full paths to work correctly): $ unzip Project5.zip; cd Project5; catkin_make; source devel/setup.bash
1. SLAM testing: Run $ sh scripts/test_slam.sh
2. Localization and navigation testing: Run $ sh scripts/test_navigation.sh
3. Navigation goal node: Run $ sh scripts/pick_objects.sh
4. Virtual objects: Run $ sh scripts/add_markers.sh
5. Home service robot: Run $ sh scripts/home_service.sh

Comments on solution:
- For the communication between pick_objects and add_markers (in home_service), the add_markers node suscribes to /odom. Due to the measurement error, I use a margin/tolerance of 0.6 when comparing the position obtained by /odom to the target position (across all axes). This may result in the object marker (dis)appearing sometimes earlier than the exact time the robot arrives at the target destination.
